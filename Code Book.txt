Preamble:
The run_analysis.R script performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course project’s definition.

1. Download the dataset and expand the zip file into a folder called UCI HAR Dataset

2. Assign variables to data
	a. features is a dataframe of dimension 561*2. 
		1. This contains the various measures derived from the Samsung watch in spacial and angular dimensions
		2. The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
	b. activitylabels 
		is a dataframe of vectors (Code, activity). The dim is 6*2
	c. subject_test
		is a dataframe of 30 participants(subjects) who took the test. The dim is 2947*1
	d. x_test <- test/X_test.txt
		is a data frame of 561 features across the 2947 observations. The dim is 2947*561 
	e. y_test <- test/Y_test.txt
		is a data frame of activities in test data. The dim is 2947*1 
	f. subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt 
		is a dataframe of train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed. dim is 7352*1
	d. x_train <- test/X_train.txt
		is a data frame of 561 features across the 7352 observations. The dim is 7352*561 
	e. y_train <- test/Y_train.txt
		is a data frame of activities in train data. The dim is 7352*1 		

3. Merge the various files together.
	a. Assumption is that the files have been split and the rows have not been randomized
	b. The x-test and x_train are merged into x_comb using rbind && y_test and y_train are merged into y_comb using rbind. 
	c. sub_comb (participant) is also merged carefully using rbind in the same sequence subject_test and subject_train using rbind()

4. 3 tables are brought together to reconstruct the full dataframe
	a. unified_table joins the columns from sub_comb, y_comb and x_comb. 
	b. dim of this table is 10299 * 563 {Dims obtained from the rbind and cbind (2947+7352)* (1+1+561)}
	
5. The exercise asks us to have a sub table that contains only columns that have either mean or std in the definition
	a. unified_table1<- is created from unified_table by grep for "mean" or "std" in col name
	b. The dim of unified_table1 is 10299 *81
	
6. Now the column is restored with human readable definitions
	a. All Acc in column name replaced by Accelerometer
	b. All Gyro in column name replaced by Gyroscope
	c. All BodyBody in column name replaced by Body
	d. All Mag in column name replaced by Magnitude
	e. All names that start with character f in column name replaced by Frequency
	f. All names that start with character t in column name replaced by Time
	
7. Now with the data that is readable and clean, the data is sub-grouped by activity and each activity by subject to arrive at the final dataframe Answer
